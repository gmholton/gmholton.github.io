Indigenous place names in Alaska---and the place-naming strategies that underlie them---
provide insight into Indigenous conceptualizations of the landscape. Inuit-Yupik place naming is grounded in human affordance; names are
assigned based on people’s relationship to the
land. In contrast, Dene place naming is highly
deterministic, based on a generative geographic
directional system.
