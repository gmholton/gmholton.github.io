The fundamental principle underlying this chapter is that linguistic data cannot be divorced from their sources. While ethical practices may differ across different research contexts, this principle remains and lies at the heart of ethics in linguistic data. As the various chapters in this volume clearly attest, the field of linguistics is evolving quickly into a more data-driven science. There is ample evidence that recognizing–-and indeed celebrating—the relationships between people, ethics, and data will ensure a more robust science of human language in which linguistic communities and associated knowledge systems play a more symmetrical role.
