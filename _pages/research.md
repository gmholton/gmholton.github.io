### Alaska Native Place Names

<img src="/images/andrews-map-sm.png" width="172" height="110" align="left" style="margin-right:15px;" >  The Alaska Native Place Names Project represents an ongoing effort to consolidate Indigenous place name documentation housed at ANLA. With support from Alaska EPSCoR in 2011 a pilot project was initiated focusing on the Lower Tanana Athabaskan language. In 2016 with support from National Science Foundation grant OPP-1624365 the project is being expanded to integrate historic maps and manuscript data with place name information within an extensible, open-source geodatabase. This project will provide a foundation for use by both researchers and community members, contributing to a better understanding of environmental knowledge while at the same time helping to preserve and promote Indigenous place names in Alaska.

### Origins of the Alor-Pantar Languages

<img src="/images/aprelations.png" width="271" height="115" align="left" style="margin-right:15px;"> Origins of the Alor-Pantar Languages</a> (2009-2016) is an NSF-funded project which seeks to unravel the linguistic prehistory of the non-Austronesian (Papuan) languages the of Alor-Pantar archipelago of southeastern Indonesia. This international project, conducted under the aegis of the European Science Foundation EuroBABEL programme, has vastly increased our knowledge of the previously under-documented Alor-Pantar language family. A volume of papers detailing the results of this project was published in 2014 (revised 2017) as [The Alor-Pantar Languages: History and Typology](http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/22) (Marian Klamer, ed.). This volume was published through Language Sciences Press, a new open-access, peer-reviewed venue; hence, the individual papers can be freely downloaded.

### Metadata Editing and Collection Management Tools (MEaCoM) ![MEaCoM](/images/saymorex_icon.png)

 The task of language documentation  requires the researcher to manage a large amount of interlinked data, including raw audio and video recordings, photographs, transcription files, annotation files, lexical databases, responses to experimental stimuli, and field observations. While standards have been developed for archiving and preserving these data, linguistic data management prior to archive deposit is often ad-hoc and idiosyncratic, without any widely-accepted practice. In particular, no standard tool exists to manage digital files and associated metadata. At best, current practice is inefficient, resulting in delays prior to archiving and requiring significant additional investment of researcher time. At worst, these bottlenecks lead to indefinite delays, with the result that research products may never be properly archived.

The MEaCoM project (2017-2020) convenes a series of workshop bringing together key stakeholders including linguists, archivists, and software developers to develop a software requirements specification and associated use cases (or “user stories”) for a metadata and collection management tool.
