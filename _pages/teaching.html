<h1>Documentary Lingusitics @ Mānoa</h1>

<p>I teach courses in  <a href="/documentary-linguistics/">Documentary Linguistics</a> as part of the Language Documentation &amp; Conservation academic program at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa.

<h1>Undergraduate Linguistics @ Mānoa</h1>
Our program offers M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in Linguistics, but motivated undergraduate students can pursue a <a href="/undergrad/">B.A. in Linguistics</a> via the Interdisciplinary Studies Program.</p>
