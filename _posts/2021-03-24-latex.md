Unlike MS Word and OpenOffice, LaTeX is not a WYSIWYG ("what you see is what you get") editor.   Instead, you write instructions which tell LaTeX how to do the formatting. This brief introduction will get you started, even if you've never used LaTeX previously. You can download a LaTeX compiler, or you can use an online compiler such as [Overleaf](http://overleaf.com/read/gpdctdsncwpc).

And as long as you're thinking about dissertation writing, be sure to take a look at the Leipzig Glossing Rules, a.k.a. the
[Generic Style Rules for Linguistics](http://www.elpublishing.org/docs/public/generic-style-rules-linguistics.pdf) (pdf).
