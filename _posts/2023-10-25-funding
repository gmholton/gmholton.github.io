Looking for ways to fund your research? Here are a few ideas.

National Science Foundation
---

The National Science Foundation (NSF) provides two main sources of funding for graduate students. 

The [Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) provides an annual stipend of $37,000 to the student and 
cost-of-education allowance of $16,000 payable to the institution. The award is for a period of three years and must be
used within five years. That means that you can cycle in and out of NSF=supported years and GAship supported years.
These awards are highly competitive, restricted to US citizens and permanent residents, and only open to those who have completed no more than one year
of graduate study. This means that you will usually apply for the award during the Fall of your second year of study.

The Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement grant provides up to $15,000 to support  expenses associated with 
dissertation research. This includes field work travel and lodging, equipment, and compensation for speakers and other community collaborators.
No stipend is allowed. There are separated application channels via the [NSF Linguistics Program](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/linguistics-program-doctoral-dissertation-research) 
and the [NSF Dynamic Language Infrastructure Program](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/dynamic-language-infrastructure-doctoral). 
Each program has two target application dates per year, but the date are not the same for each program.
Students apply as the co-PI on a proposal with their PhD advisor serving as PI.

Endangered Languages Documentation Programme
---

The [Endangered Languages Documentation Programme](http://eldp.net) (ELDP) is a private funder dedicated to creating 
an enduring record of the world's languages, focusing on the creation and archiving of richly annotated multimedia 
documentation. Grant recipients must commit to depositing openly accessible docuementary materials with the 
[Endangered Languages Archive](http://elararchive.org) (ELAR).
The Small Grants program provides up to â‚¬10,000 for a period of one year. The Individual Graduate Scholarship provides up to three 
years of support including a field research costs, a stipend, and tuition support. Applications are due in the Fall.
