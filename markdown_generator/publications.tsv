2015-12-01	East is not a ‘big bird’: The etymology of the star Altair in the Carolinian sidereal compass.	Oceanic Linguistics	We argue that the Micronesian constellation centered on Altair, known in Lamotrek as Mailap, has been mistakenly identified in previous literature with another constellation centered on Sirius, known as Mannap. The latter is literally the ‘Big Bird’ and is well known in parts of Polynesia as well. Confusing this Big Bird with Altair has led to much confusion in the literature on Carolinian navigational arts. We trace the history of how this error arose and why it has persisted over time, and we also suggest an alternate etymology for Mailap.

2019-03-01	Language and Toponymy in Alaska and Beyond	University of Hawai‘i Press	It is difficult to imagine place names research in Alaska without the work of James Kari. Through his tireless field work and advocacy, Dr. Kari has collaborated with speakers of all of Alaska’s Dene languages to help build a comprehensive record of Dene geographic knowledge. When Jim came to Alaska in 1972, the documentation of Dene languages was fragmentary at best, and the only records of Native place names were those found inaccurately spelled on maps and gazetteers. Now nearly a half a century later we are surrounded by Native names—from <i>K’esugi Ridge</i> in Susitna Valley to <i>Troth Yeddha’</i> on the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus. The increased visibility of Alaska Native place names today is due in no small part to Jim’s efforts. His work has inspired a generation of scholars, including the contributors to this volume, and continues to set the standard for toponymy research in Alaska and beyond. 	Holton, Gary and Thomas F.

2018-12-31	Reflections on Language Documentation 20 Years After Himmelmann 1998	University of Hawai‘i Press	This volume reflects on key issues in the field of language documentation on the 20 year anniversary of Nikolaus Himmelmann’s seminal article “Documentary and descriptive linguistics” in the journal [Linguistics](https://doi.org/10.1515/ling.1998.36.1.161). Himmelmann’s central argument that language documentation should “be conceived of as a fairly independent field of linguistic inquiry and practice” has prompted major theoretical and practical shifts, helping to establish documentary linguistics as a genuine subfield of linguistics. Now 20 years later we are able ask: how has this new field evolved?  In order to address this question, we invited 38 experts from around the world to reflect on either particular issues within the realm of language documentation or particular regions where language documentation projects are being carried out. The issues discussed in this volume represent a broad and diverse range of topics from multiple perspectives and for multiple purposes. Some topics have been hotly debated over the past two decades, while others have emerged more recently. Many contributors also speculate on what comes next, looking at the future of documentary linguistics from a variety of perspectives. Hence, the 31 vignettes provide not only reflections on where we have been but also a glimpse of where the field might be headed.

2017-03-30	A unified system of spatial orientation in the Austronesian and non-Austronesian languages of Halmahera	NUSA	The Austronesian and non-Austronesian languages of Halmahera Island and vicinity share a system of absolute spatial orientation in which the up-down axis is oriented horizontally along the coast. The systems in the individual languages have converged so that it is possible to speak of a single Halmaheran system of orientation whose spatial semantics are independent of language. However, the factors determining the orientation of the upcoast-downcoast axis—which way is up and which is down—have remained elusive. Drawing on a comprehensive survey of the orientation of the upcoast-downcoast axis in Halmahera, we propose an account of orientation in Halmahera which unites both coastal and riverine uses of the up-down axis. We suggest that the orientation of the upcoast direction toward the interior of bays derives from its origin as an upstream directional. An originally non-Austronesian system of riverine orientation has diffused into the Austronesian languages and been adapted to form a pan-Halmaheran directional system.	Holton, Gary. 2017.
