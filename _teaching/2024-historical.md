## Overview

Historical linguistics is concerned with how and why languages change over time and the resulting historical relationships between languages. This is a hands-on course. In addition to examining the basic theoretical underpinnings of historical linguistics, we will devote a significant amount of time to doing historical linguistics by working through exercises and data sets drawn from a variety of languages.

This is a survey course which briefly addresses most of the key areas of what is a very broad subfield of linguistics. Many of the topics introduced here—e.g. The Comparative Method, subgrouping, language contact, grammaticization, and phylogenetic methods—could easily merit an entire course of their own. Nevertheless, the current course provides a solid foundation for further exploration of a range of topics in historical linguistics.

While this course will be of interest to those wishing to specialize in the study of historical linguistics, the course is aimed at a wider audience of linguistic students working across a range of subfields. Language change touches all areas of the study of language. Whatever one’s field of interest—from phonology to syntax to sociolinguistics to psycholinguistics to documentation to revitalization—knowledge of historical linguistics theory and methods can help you to better understand the phenomena you study. Indeed, it is one of the key tenets of historical linguistics that language must be understood in its historical context. 

<!-- This course is a hands-on introduction to the theory and practice of historical linguistics. Upon successful completion of this course,  students will be comfortable with the core principles of the comparative method and the skills necessary to develop a reconstruction of novel data. Much of the course will be devoted to working with data sets in order to gain experience  working with the comparative method. -->

*  theories of sound change
*  causes of irregularity in sound change
*  semantic change
*  morphological and  syntactic change
*  subgrouping
*  linguistic evidence for determining homelands
*  linguistic approaches to culture-history
*  computational approaches to historical linguistics

## Prerequisite

Introductory course in linguistics and familiarity with baisc linear phonology.

## Materials
